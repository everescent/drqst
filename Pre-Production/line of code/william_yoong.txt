What I liked:    I like the fact that coding AIs is very hard to code as you are basically creating another life form from scratch,
                 but the results is satisfying when you see the work you have put in come to life. This semester has taught me that
                 I enjoy coding AIs even though there are times where I was really frustrated at why the AI wasn't behaving the way
                 I wanted it to.
              
What I disliked: I disliked the fact that my knowledge is not as good as my peers. I believe that the things I have done can behaving
                 accomplished in a much more efficient way than what I have done right now. But I also have no idea on how it can be
                 improved or where I should start.
             
What I learned:  I have learn the usage of inheritance, the different form of access and the usage of virtual functions. I have also
                 learn how to use state machines for AI behavior

What I liked: 
	I'm quite satisfied that the Level importer was able to work as it allows my level designer to work with a script
	instead of hard coding the positions. I also like how the general user interface turned out despite the lack of time 
	to work on it, as there is a certain level of interactivity. 
	
What I disliked:
	As the tech lead, I felt that I wasn't able to work a lot on the low-level design or the engine as I spent too much 
	time making the collision system to work. In the end, not much of the collision functions was used as it was not needed
	This taught me the hard way that it is important to determine what the game needs early and add it in the engine.
	Also, I feel disappointed that I was not able to make a working level editor in time, as it would have streamline 
	our game development process. 
	
What I learned:
	I have a much clearer view on how the Game Engine should be designed now and to prioritize which components better.
	I've also learned when to encapsulate components in the Engine and when not to, as sometimes there are more efficient 
	methods to do things. Lastly, I learned a lot more about Collision and how it works now, as well as have a clearer 
	idea on how a level editor would work.

What I liked   : 
  I liked how my particle system turned out. It managed to be able to 
  produce a variety of particle behavior for our game. I also liked how 
  the general graphics system turned out. I wanted to streamline the 
  process of creating a mesh, and it worked pretty well. Lastly, I 
  am satisfied with how my boss A.I. - Merlin, turned out. I researched 
  online and many said to use a state machine. I looked at code samples 
  to study the design and implemented it for Merlin and Archer. 
              
What I disliked: 
  I did not like how I implemented the Audio System at all. I feel it is a 
  failure. It was only later that I realized I should not have more than one 
  instance of the Audio System. It was a mistake on my part but it was too late 
  to correct the implementation. 
             
What I learned : 
  I learned more advanced techniques of c++ during the course of this 
  GAM module. I learned about move constructors, lambdas, A.I. state machines, 
  function objects, etc. This module has allowed me to develop and enforce my 
  skill set. Furthermore, I have a better understanding of game engine 
  architecture now that I have completed both GAM and CS230.

What I liked: 
I liked being able to design my own levels with our level reader and how to 
Boss AI turned out. Designing a level, let alone 6 levels, was no easy task 
as I tried to make them each unique in their own right. I learnt how to use 
verticality and how to give players different choices in the form of 
routes to take throughout the level.

What I disliked: 
I disliked the fact that my implementation of the physics wasn't used even 
though I managed a working demo of it early on in the project. I also disliked 
that despite being the lead designer, I was not capable enough to develop 
the mechanics as I visualised them.

What I learned: 
I learnt a lot about general coding methods and structures from my group mates 
as they were more experienced programmers than me. Implementing their code in 
my levels taught me that there will not always be a solution for evey problem, 
and that modifications to pre-existing functions and classes were sometimes needed.

  BUGLIST / FEEDBACK TO ADDRESS

  [LEVEL DESIGN]
 - Add a lot more coins, and slightly more power-ups (would make game play faster and less boring)
 
  [MECHANICS]

  [BUGS]
 - If player moves when restarting, player can fall off the map

  [NEW]
 - Boxes will spawn randomised power-up when broken (low-priority)
 - hit animation needs to be more frames (don't play)
 - snapping needs to snap to where the 2 meshes meet rather than back to centre
 - JUMP IS STILL STICKY (cannot be fixable)
 - KA needs indicators for spawning mobs (make do)
 - HOW TO PLAY SCREEN
 - something bout getting hit while in the air doesn't kill the player all the time, (related) life check needs to check for <= 0 rather than == 0???
 - player outside borders (death borders)

//Delete above as well when done fixing

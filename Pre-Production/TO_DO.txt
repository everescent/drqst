  BUGLIST / FEEDBACK TO ADDRESS

  [LEVEL DESIGN]
 - Add a lot more coins, and slightly more power-ups (would make game play faster and less boring)
 - 3-1, got like some short-cut is it intended? 
 - Stage 2-2 Invul is put in a place where it cant really be used well
 
  [MECHANICS]
 - 3-1, not recommended for death pits as there's no condition that will 'kill' the dragon 

  [BUGS]
 - Upon 'death' (or rather when the stage restarts), sometimes the camera 
   would snap to the spawn point while sometimes it'll slowly move 
   to the spawn point (if the dragon restart too far from the original point)
 - If player moves when restarting, player can fall off the map
 - Upon death and restarting, camera offset Y will be too low SOMETIMES

  [NEW]
 - Boxes will spawn randomised power-up when broken (low-priority)
 - hit animation needs to be more frames (don't play)
 - snapping needs to snap to where the 2 meshes meet rather than back to centre
 - JUMP IS STILL STICKY
 - KA needs indicators for spawning mobs
 - STAGE/STATE TRANSITION (fade in/out black bg)
 - HOW TO PLAY SCREEN
 - something bout getting hit while in the air doesn't kill the player all the time, (related) life check needs to check for <= 0 rather than == 0???
 - player outside borders (death borders)

//Delete above as well when done fixing

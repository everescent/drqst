  BUGLIST / FEEDBACK TO ADDRESS

  [LEVEL DESIGN]
 - Increase the starting health for stage 2/3 to 4, Boss stage to 5. make everything 5
 - Add a lot more coins, and slightly more power-ups (would make game play faster and less boring)
 - 3-1, got like some short-cut is it intended? 
 - 3-2 Winning platform is unreachable (FIXED)
 - 3-2 the heart pick-up overlaps with the wall (FIXED)
 - Stage 2-2 Invul is put in a place where it cant really be used well
 
  [MECHANICS]
 - Invul pick-up makes Dragon faded BUT the time it's faded does not corresponds to it's invul time (should be fixed)
 - 3-1, not recommended for death pits as there's no condition that will 'kill' the dragon 

  [BUGS]
 - Upon 'death' (or rather when the stage restarts), sometimes the camera 
   would snap to the spawn point while sometimes it'll slowly move 
   to the spawn point (if the dragon restart too far from the original point)
 - Main Menu music not looping
 - When pause and unpaused, music will stop playing (fixed)
 - If player moves when restarting, player can fall off the map
 - Upon death and restarting, camera offset Y will be too low SOMETIMES

  [AI]
 - Increase the speed of the arrows ( mentioned by play-testers before, and Elie during Alpha presentation)
 - Increase Knight's movement speed, currently I can kill it without even seeing it's attack animation. (FIXED)
 - Implement mute / unmute for AI sound effects (add function to mute for all AI)

  [NEW]
 - Add gameplay messages throughout the stages, 
   can be 'implemented' using the same background sprite as the Message board 
   in the tutorial stage. Can be displayed either via U.I easily. 
   I would just need the sprite then display it at the start of the 
   stage and fade it out.
 - Boxes will spawn randomised power-up when broken (low-priority)
 
 - hit animation needs to be more frames (don't play)
 - camera needs to be faster
 - 3-3 restart bug 
 - snapping needs to snap to where the 2 meshes meet rather than back to centre
 - JUMP IS STILL STICKY
 - KA needs indicators for spawning mobs
 - KA homing swords need to be slower or have a wind-up
 - STAGE/STATE TRANSITION (fade in/out black bg)
 - HOW TO PLAY SCREEN
 - something bout getting hit while in the air doesn't kill the player all the time, (related) life check needs to check for <= 0 rather than == 0???
 - player outside borders (death borders)

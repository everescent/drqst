Coding Methods: 

  Macros: 
    -No Macros allowed except for defines

  User-Defined Types (Class/Structs):
    -All members MUST be initialized in the members initialization list 
    -multiple constructors are allowed by function overloading BUT please 
    comment on why/when the user have to use which constructors
    
  Function naming conventions: 
    Action_Object
    Action: Describe the action and functionality of the function
    Object: Describe the object that is to be generated or affected by it
    E.g:
      Create_Dragon
      Create_KingA
      Phase2_KingA
      Apply_Gravity
      
  In-Built types: 
  
  Variable naming:
    member variables are to be named as m_<type><name>
    e.g:
      m_Dragon_Health
    Static members are to be named as stm_<type><name>
    Reference variables are to be named as r_<type><name>
    Pointer variables are to be named as p_<type><name>
  
  Formatting/Documentation :
  
    Standard proper indentation of C++ code
    Maximum column length to be 170
    Maximum width per function to be 80, to prevent hard-coding 
    Tab size to be 2, and to be replaced by whitespace
      This can be done by: Tools > Options > Text Editor > C++ > Tabs 
    Comments to describe function usage to be done in header files
    Usage of engine functions should be understandable by reading the comments
    to ensure that it'll be understandable to our lecturers too 
    
  
  File Locations:
  
    All files are to be in folders that contains their respective .cpp and .h 
    Folders are to be named to describe what the files functionality is
  
  Source Control:
    SVN and GitHub (backup)    
  
  Rules: 
  All files are to be committed only AFTER testing AND commenting.
  Please include a summary of the files committed and functionality 
  in the comments/summary while committing via SVN/GitHub
    This is to facilitate and track progress especially if a particular engine
    is not fully completed 
    e.g: 
    Collision Engine completed using AABB system, currently works with 
    mob collision and platform collision.
    Working on MC with projectile collision.
